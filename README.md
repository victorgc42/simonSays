## Introduction

Simon Says is an electronic game created by Ralph Baer and Howard J. Morrison in the year 1978 based on the well-known children's game that bears the same name. He had a great success during the 80s and 90s, and variants are still sold today the same game, but with improved electronics. In the original version the game has four buttons, and each button has an assigned LED. The LEDs light up randomly creating an increasingly long pattern, the player has to repeat the pattern by pressing the buttons without fail, if the player fails, the game ends and starts over from the beginning. The goal is to achieve longest possible sequence.
